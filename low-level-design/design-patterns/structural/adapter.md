# Adapter Design Pattern

## Purpose
Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects/systems to collaborate.

## Steps

## Example
Different countries follow differnt standards for sockets of electrical appliances. So while traveling international, using adapter can help make plug and socket compatible.

## Cons
- Since the adapter pattern introduces an additional layer, there might be a slight performance overhead, noticable in high performance systems.
